# Workshop in Applied Ethics
## Answer the Questions

1) If all people were ethical in their interactions, there would be no need for the judiciary system since law enforcement and law itself is a direct product from trying to control unethical behavior.
2) 

## Class Activities

1) In a small group up to 5 people, imagine you are a small tech startup. Then:
i)
   Leean Woo
   
   Vincent Feil
   
   Jessica Gardner
   
   Joaquin Trujillo
   
   Bruce Liu
   
   ii) President: Vincent Feil
   
   iii) Computer that can run any Operating System/Software 
   
2) Describe the ways your innovation, if realized, would affect society.

  i) Pros: Economic freedom for the individual, ease of development, 
  cons: hinders ability to adapt to different softwares/UI, job market would be affected due to companies losing proprietary ownership of specific products, short term: Would force custoemrs to discard old laptops adding on to the harm of our environment.
  
  ii) a. Immediately upon launch: Would cause a spike in laptops being thrown away and cause excess waste and impact on the enviornment 
      b. After enough time for it to be absorbed into everyday life: Would lose the ability to adapt to different softwares or User Interfaces. 
  
  Bonus: A way to incentivize employees, is to hold random checks on random employees to make sure our code of ethics is being upheld. If after the check it is found that they are being upheld, provide a monetary award, because most of the time a person might be unethical is due to greed and greed being a product of money.
 Also if employees pass inspections, they will be more eligable to raises and promotions.
